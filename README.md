AngularJS SLC Group - Meetup topics, suggestions, and speaker signups! http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/

Our compatriots to the south have had a lot of success with using a repo to track Meetup ideas and volunteers, so we've decided to try it out as well!

###[Look at Proposed Topics](https://github.com/AngularJSUtah/meetups-slc-group/issues)

We invite all of you to **propose** ideas for presentations you would like to see or things you would like to share with the group. While you're in here, **vote** for the presentations you would like to see or **volunteer** to present on an unclaimed topic.
